# We now use the svm() function to fit the support vector classifier for a given value of the cost parameter.
# Here we demonstrate the use of this function on a two-dimensional example so that we can plot the resulting
# decision boundary.
# We begin by generating the observations, which belong to two classes.

# We begin by checking whether the classes are linearly separable.
plot(x, col=(3-y))
# They are not. Next, we fit the support vector classifier.
# Note that in order for the svm() function to perform classification
# we must encode the response as a factor variable.
# We now create a data frame with the response coded as a factor.
dat <- data.frame(x = x,y = as.factor(y))
svmfit <- svm(y ~., data=dat, kernel="linear", cost=10,scale=FALSE)
# The argument scale=FALSE tells the svm() function not to scale each feature to
# have mean zero or standard deviation one;
# depending on the application, one might prefer to use scale=TRUE.
# We can now plot the support vector classifier obtained:
plot(svmfit , dat)
# Note that the two arguments to the plot.svm() function are the output of the call to svm(),
#as well as the data used in the call to svm().
# The region of feature space that will be assigned to the âˆ’1 class is shown in light blue,
# and the region that will be assigned to the +1 class is shown in purple.

# In this case one additional observation is misclassified.
# Now consider a situation in which the two classes are linearly separable.
# Then we can find a separating hyperplane using the svm() function.
# We first further separate the two classes in our simulated data so that they are linearly separable:
